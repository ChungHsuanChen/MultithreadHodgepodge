# Multithread-Hodgepodge

Multithread-Hodgepodge is an open-source project which implements thread-safe data structures in CS.
Multithread-Hodgepodge is written in C language. It utilizes object-oriented concept to make the code structured.
Multithread-Hodgepodge is expected to be library of system software(device driver) with variety of useful thread-safe data structure and function.


# Multithread-Hodgepodge Architecture
- common: Macro used commonly across different data strucrture.
- list: The kernel implementation of Multithread-Hodgepodge Architecture. This struture includes almost all implementation details of function and other structure utilize the implemetation in list.
- stack: Implementation of thread-safe stack structure.
- queue: Implementation of thread-safe queue structure.
- priority_queue: Implementation of thread-safe priority queue structure.
- RingBuffer: Implementation of thread-safe Ring Buffer.

# Multithread-Hodgepodge Advantages
- Object-Oriented C Programming Style.
- Tidy Coding style.
- Implemetation of many household data structures.
- Thread-safe data structures.
